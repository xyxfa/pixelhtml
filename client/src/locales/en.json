Within a workday, you need to control the character by clicking or using the keyboard to maintain \"physical balance\" while working. The longer you work, the greater the challenge—the boss's suspicion will gradually accumulate. Pay attention to the shaking warning icon; it indicates when the boss will appear. Respond to randomly appearing pop-up events and boss questions; your choices will affect the suspicion value. The character's expressions will also reflect their status in real-time, making each response more vivid. Balance operations, seize opportunities, respond cleverly—let's see how long you can last!",
